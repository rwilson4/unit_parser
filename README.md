Unit Parser and Conversions

Because the last thing anyone asked for was another library for
converting between feet and meters in Python. I'm not even trying to
make this the best one! I wrote this initially because I wanted a unit
*parser*. My homebrew-calc tool needs a way of parsing physical
quantities in text files like JSON, so I wrote this. I wrote the
original version in Matlab way back in the day. Put here (a) for
posterity, so everyone can appreciate how unoriginal I am, and (b)
because I can't be bothered to take the time to learn one of the
myriad other unit conversion libraries and refactor my code
accordingly. My self-loathing will continue to grow and I will
eventually switch over to one of the established libraries, but for
now, here we are!
